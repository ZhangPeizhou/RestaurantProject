- Topic: 
This project is to use pug, Express and other common web development tools and PostgresQL database to build an online food ordering application. Users can search for other users by searching for their names and see the history of other users' orders. However, if the target user's privacy is set to true, then you must log in to get information about that user. After logging in, users are free to change their privacy Settings. Privacy is set to false, so that all data about the user is visible to all users. If privacy is set to true, only logged-in users are visible. Meanwhile, if users want to order food, they must log in first. When ordering, users can choose from different restaurants, each with a minimum consumption and delivery fee. After confirming the order, the system will automatically record and display the user's latest five historical orders.
